# FIDEL iOS SDK

Our SDK helps you add card linking technology to your iOS apps in minutes. It captures credit/debit card numbers securely and links them to your programs.

## Installation

We recommend using [CocoaPods][642d6fa5] to integrate Fidel SDK with your project.

[642d6fa5]: https://cocoapods.org/ "CocoaPods"

Add a `Podfile` (if you don't have one already), by running the following command: `pod init`.

### Step 1

Add Fidel pod (for Swift 5.2+, XCode 11.4+):

```ruby
pod 'Fidel'
```

or if you're still using Xcode 11.2, with Swift 5.1:

```ruby
pod 'Fidel', '~>1.6.2'
```

or if you're using Xcode 10.3, with Swift 5:

```ruby
pod 'Fidel', '~>1.5.1'
```

or if you're using Swift 4.2.1:

```ruby
pod 'Fidel', '~>1.4.4'
```

or if you're using Swift 4.1:

```ruby
pod 'Fidel', '~>1.3.7'
```

or if you're using Swift 4.0.2:

```ruby
pod 'Fidel', '~>1.2.8'
```

or in case you're on **Swift 3.0**, use the `1.1.8` tag instead:

```ruby
pod 'Fidel', '~>1.1.8'
```

### Step 2
In order to allow scanning cards with the camera, make sure to add the key `NSCameraUsageDescription` to your app's `Info.plist` and set the value to a string describing why your app needs to use the camera (e.g. "To scan credit cards."). This string will be displayed when the app initially requests permission to access the camera.

##### Step 3 (skip if you have a Swift project)

If you have an Objective-C project and did not add any Swift code yet, please set the `Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries` flag in Build Settings to `YES`. For more detailed information about this setting, please read this [Apple material](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1881/_index.html).

##### Troubleshooting
In case Cocoapods doesn't find the Fidel specs or it finds older specs, try updating with `pod update`. After updating, run `pod install`.

### Usage

Import the SDK in your code:
##### Swift
```swift
import Fidel
```

##### Objective-C
```objectivec
#import <Fidel/Fidel-Swift.h>
```

Set your public SDK Key (`pk_test` or `pk_live`) and the `programId` you want to link cards to:

##### Swift
```swift
Fidel.apiKey = "pk_test_7ty6i7..."
Fidel.programId = "3a7a169a-..."
```

##### Objective-C
```objectivec
[FLFidel setApiKey:@"pk_test_7ty6i7..."];
[FLFidel setProgramId:@"3a7a169a-..."];
```

To start card scanning automatically:

##### Swift
```swift
Fidel.autoScan = true
```

##### Objective-C
```objectivec
[FLFidel setAutoScan:YES];
```

To customise the view with a custom banner:

##### Swift
```swift
Fidel.bannerImage = UIImage(named: "some_image_asset.png")
```

##### Objective-C
```objectivec
[FLFidel setBannerImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"myImage"]];
```

If you don't set a banner image, we'll just remove the top banner space entirely and card linking UI will stay on top.

Then, present the Fidel view controller:

##### Swift

```swift
Fidel.present(presentingViewControllerInstance)
```

##### Objective-C

```objectivec
[FLFidel present:self onCardLinkedCallback:nil onCardLinkFailedCallback:nil];
```

Optionally, you can pass callbacks to be notified if the card was linked:

##### Swift

```swift
Fidel.present(self, onCardLinkedCallback: { (linkResult: LinkResult) in
	print(linkResult.id)
}, onCardLinkFailedCallback: { (err: LinkError) in
	print(err.message)
})
```

##### Objective-C
```objectivec
[FLFidel present:self onCardLinkedCallback:^(FLLinkResult * _Nonnull result) {
    NSLog(@"%@", result);
} onCardLinkFailedCallback:^(FLLinkError * _Nonnull error) {
    NSLog(@"%@", error);
}];
```

## Customize checkbox consent text

For customizing the checkbox consent, please use the following APIs:

```swift
Fidel.companyName = "Your Company Name Inc." //(Maximum 60 characters);
Fidel.privacyURL = "https://yourcompany.com/privacyURL" //(must be a valid URL)
Fidel.deleteInstructions = "Your delete instructions" //(Maximum 60 characters);
```

The default for `companyName` is `"Company Name"`.
The default for `deleteInstructions` is `"going to your account settings"`.

### Consent text for United States and Canada

United States or Canada will be available for card linking, if they are added to the `Fidel.allowedCountries` array **or** if you don't set a value for this property (which makes US and Canada available for the user to select, by default, along with all the other allowed countries).

When the user selects United States or Canada, a different consent text will be applied. In addition to the parameters described above, you can set the following parameters for the consent text:

```java
Fidel.programName = "your program name"; // (Maximum 60 characters);
Fidel.termsConditionsURL = "https://yourcompany.com/termsConditions"; // (cannot be nil, in this situation, and be a valid URL)
```

The default replacement value for `programName` is `"our"` (in  English; for other languages, the words adjust to make sense).

The `termsConditionsURL` is mandatory in this case.

If you don't set a privacy policy URL (which is different from the terms & conditions URL), the corresponding wording will not be displayed.

For USA & Canada, the following would be an example Terms & Conditions text, for Cashback Inc (an example company name):

*By submitting your card information and checking this box, you authorize Visa to monitor and share transaction data with Fidel (our service provider) to participate in  program. You also acknowledge and agree that Fidel may share certain details of your qualifying transactions with Cashback Inc to enable your participation in  program and for other purposes in accordance with the Cashback Inc Terms and Conditions, Cashback Inc privacy policy and Fidel’s Privacy Policy. You may opt-out of transaction monitoring on the linked card at any time by contacting support.*

For the rest of the world:

*I authorise Visa to monitor my payment card to identify transactions that qualify for a reward and for Visa to share such information with Cashback Inc, to enable my card linked offers and target offers that may be of interest to me. For information about Cashback Inc privacy practices, please see the privacy policy. You may opt-out of transaction monitoring on the payment card you entered at any time by contacting support.*

## Localisation

The SDK's default language is English, but it's also localised for French and Swedish languages. When the device has either `Français (Canada)` or `Svenska (Sverige)` as its language, the appropriate texts will be displayed. Please note that developer error messages are in English only and they will not be displayed to the user.

Please make sure that your project also supports localisation for the languages that you want to support.

#### Supported card schemes
We currently support _Visa_, _Mastercard_ and _AmericanExpress_, but you can choose to support only one, two or all three. You can do that by using `supportedCardSchemes`. Please note that the value of this set cannot be an empty set.

Check the example below:

##### Swift

```swift
Fidel.supportedCardSchemes = [.visa, .mastercard, .americanExpress] //you can also add .amex
```

##### Objective-C

```objectivec
NSSet *supportedCardSchemes = [[NSSet alloc] initWithObjects:
                                   @(FLCardSchemeVisa),
                                   @(FLCardSchemeMastercard),
                                   @(FLCardSchemeAmericanExpress),
                                   nil];
FLFidel.objc_supportedCardSchemes = supportedCardSchemes;
```

#### Allowed countries

Set the allowed countries by using the following property:

```swift
Fidel.allowedCountries = [.unitedKingdom, .ireland]
```

in Objective-C, it would look like the following:

```objectivec
FLFidel.objc_allowedCountries = @[@(FLCountryIreland), @(FLCountryUnitedKingdom)];
```

The allowed countries are: `.canada`, `.ireland`, `.japan`, `.sweden`, `.unitedArabEmirates`, `.unitedKingdom`, `.unitedStates`. By default the `allowedCountries` array includes all countries allowed by Fidel.

When you set **a single country** in the array, the card linking screen will not show the country picker UI. It will use the set country for linking the card.

When more than one country is set in the array, the UI selects the first one as the default country, but the user can between the values that you set.

#### Default selected country

```swift
Fidel.defaultSelectedCountry = .unitedKingdom
```

Use this parameter to set the country that will be selected by default when opening the card enrollment screen.

The default value is `.unitedKingdom`.


### Documentation

In test environment use our VISA, Mastercard or American Express test card numbers:

VISA: _4444000000004***_ (the last 3 numbers can be anything)

Mastercard: _5555000000005***_ (the last 3 numbers can be anything)

American Express: _3400000000003**_ or _3700000000003**_ (the last 2 numbers can be anything)

#### Detect when user canceled card linking

Check the `code` property of the error object you receive in the `onCardLinkFailedCallback` closure. When the user cancels card linking, the `code` is `user-canceled`. The error message is `User canceled card linking`.
